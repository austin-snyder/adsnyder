              I have worked on numerous projects throughout my career as both a programmer and
              environmental scientist! My passion primarily lies in the intersection between data,
              algorithms, and how they can support the clean energy transition, but I have loved
              working on projects in a wide variet of areas.

                As part of an internship with Florida Atlantic University in 2021, I worked with a research
                team within the Institute for Sensing and Embedded Network Systems Engineering (I-SENSE).
                The research primarily centered on the optimization of buoyancy-controlled ocean curren turbines
                through the application of control co-design (CCD) methodologies. Optimization methods often
                utilized dynamic & linear programming methods. Computationally-expensive aspects of the design
                were optimized through supervised machine learning processes. Results are currently under review
                for appearance in various conferences & will (hopefully) eventually be accepted for journal publishing.

                Transition-Metal Complexes (TMCs) are molecules consisting of one or more
                transition-metal centers surrounded by organic molecules (known as ligands),
                bound to the metal atom by dative bonds. These molecules are of interest to
                researchers because of their potential to mimic the efficiency and specificity
                of catalytic biological molecules, such as enzymes. However, engineering these
                molecules for use in catalysis is difficult and computationally expensive, owing
                to the large combinatorial space of of transition metals and ligands. As part of
                our final project for our machine learning course, myself and another student
                used a simple machine learning approach to predict the metal-center charges of
                TMCS based off structural features of the molecules. Additionally, these methods
                were theorized with the purpose of being abstract enough to be easily expanded
                to other electronic properties in order to eventually facilitate the prediction of complete
                electronic profiles of TMCs. Machine learning has emerged in the chemical
                sciences as a method for producing models of complicated systems with large
                amounts of variables. While these methods have been extensively applied to
                areas such as drug discovery, there have been little applications to the discovery
                and modeling of TMCs. Here, we use simple machine learning methods to predict the
                metal-center charges  of TMCs based off structural features of the molecules.
                The use of these methods could be easily expanded to other electronic properties
                with the goal of creating models capable of predicting complete electronic profiles
                of TMCs.

                As part of an internship with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in 2020,
                I worked with a team of other developers on augmentation and testing of REopt Lite
                (now known as REopt Web Tool). Throughout this process, I developed Python and R algorithms
                to collect and analyze data on the geographic viability of natural gas power across
                the United States, presenting the results in the form of a paper & poster at a conference.
                Upon completion of my research & testing, I wrote & published API documentation for REopt Lite.
