      Solution
  
      future scenarios were based on IPCC climate scenarios for amount of carbon in the atmosphere
  
      aggregate of numerous ensemble members of climate forecasts to get a standardized dataset of future wind and solar resources (wind speed + surface solar radiation) for every hour from 2025-2070, grouped based on IPCC climate change scenarios
      analyzed the standardized dataset using modern tools to approximate the generation of wind + solar installations given various future scenarios (based on IPCC climate change scenarios), goal of determining efficacy of current & planned installations

      text-2=" Problem
      wind turbines are literally big enough to completely change wind patterns in the area they’re installed in; need to take existing farms into account when considering future development of turbines in the same area + vice versa
      Solution
      ERCOT has existing data for a lot of farms → 
      longform report that targeted current, future, and potential/planned developments of turbines; provide explanation of activity changes for current wind farms + model impacts on current system from future developments using that data
